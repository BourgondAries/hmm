# IDEAS #
	(Favorite colored line between two favorited bubbles) 
	If factbox is active and you teleport to bubble, load content of this bubble to factbox
	Calibri font everywhere. Host font like this?: (http://jsfiddle.net/zMKge/)
	Create short animation tutorials for editing

# MILESTONES #
	#### UPCOMING ####
	First 100 nodes
	#### REACHED ####

# TODO #
	Semantic zoom (Basic Arithmetic, Symbolics, Geometry, Probability, ...)
	Loading screen (Currently nothing shows until page is loaded)

# IN PROGRESS #
	KEVIN: Custom node colour

# DONE #
	OLE: Make 10 new bubbles with content before 17.07 23.59
	KEVIN: Create a button for factBox to almost completely maximize and become opaque
	KEVIN: Reset the scrollbar to top after closing a factbox (opening another factbox may start with the scrollbar already down)
	KEVIN: Short cut to places around the canvas (Teleport functionality? Press X, opens small writable window, write 3000, -30400, enter, move to that location, or write an ID number) - "Hyperlinks to bubbles (Use onclick to teleport to a bubble)": Use <a> with onclick="teleportTo(nodeID)" or coordinate.
	KEVIN: Random IDs for nodes to avoid merge conflicts
	KEVIN: Right-mouse button editing interface
	KEVIN: Draw a line from Q'd and an arrow for R'd bubbles
	KEVIN: Allow bubbles to be unmastered
	OLE: Bubble text fitting still need some optimization (long vs short two letter words)
	KEVIN: Mark bubble as favorite/interesting/(?) :)
	KEVIN: New color to relevant curves when 'I master this' is clicked
	KEVIN: Persistent script storage of mastered nodes
	KEVIN: Add CSS style for common HTML elements for factbox (strong)
	KEVIN: Cull floaty drawing to screen boundaries, currently takes up 1/4th of the frametime
	KEVIN: Create favicon for the site
	KEVIN: Make the FactBox scrollbar have a nicer style
	KEVIN: Fix style issues and lineups
	KEVIN: Different colors for 'I master this'/'Edit' and 'Done'/'Cancel' than green and red
	KEVIN: Implement Data.js generator (with button) and automatic download
	OLE: Make mouse stay on same place when zooming with scrollwheel
	KEVIN: 'I master this' button in/around factbox
	KEVIN: Editor for editing a specific bubble (HTML)
	OLE: Use percentages of the window to position and size factBox
	OLE: Sound effect when clicking/space on a bubble
	OLE: Move random color strings into Colors.js
	OLE: Improve bubble text-fitting
	KEVIN: 'Edit' button somewhere when factbox is opened
	KEVIN: Make the zoom zoom toward position of the mouse - Only for MOUSE zoom, keyboard zoom stays centered
	KEVIN: Help menu button; describe keyboard shortcuts
	KEVIN: On-screen text when an edit mode (move, link) has been engaged
	OLE: Starting in narrow window with FactBox, scrolling down, resizing window to max, doesn't scroll back up
	OLE: Music class for queing and loading after finishing
	KEVIN: ~~Right-click~~ (Q,R,T) add-node or 'Editor Mode', since editing Data.js is a pain in the ass. <- This could be in dev-mode?
	KEVIN: Create variable for holding keystates (e.g. KEY_W: 87)
	OLE: Sounds icon and text collide for initially small windows
	KEVIN: Re-design Data.js to allow nodes to easily change position - Allow curves to 'normalize' after move. Moving nodes does not recalculate the connected lines
	KEVIN: Make sound text opaque if the mouse is kept there
	KEVIN: Content in info box is allowed to be scrolled too far down if scrolling aggressively
	KEVIN: If you press spacebar and then move the mouse and click you end up in the same place
	OLE: Info box class, scrolling in factBox
	KEVIN: If the screen center is on a bubble, and you press a non-move key, the collision sound will activate
	KEVIN: Create tutorial bubble sequence in the beginning
	OLE: Sound toggle button (bgm og sfx) (ALL/BGM/SFX/NONE)
	KEVIN: Create remote random music loader service
	OLE: Add 'm' key for quick mute
	KEVIN: Add keys - and + for zooming
	KEVIN: BUG: Zooming out doesn't transform the mouse coordinates correctly, you can't click on Bubbles
	KEVIN: Limit zoom range and avoid usage of multipliers
	KEVIN: Zoom functionality (tricky?)
	OLE: Bubble + Bubbles klasse
	KEVIN: Use a single JS file for storing all bubbles and curves - this makes it easy for anyone to add something
	KEVIN: Add dev-key for showing various stats, most importantly current position
	KEVIN: Use a gradient texture instead of the heavy fillrect
	KEVIN: Center the old position after an onResize event
	KEVIN: Different radii floaties
	OLE/KEVIN: Curve class (the curves connecting bubbles)
	KEVIN: Context class for managing global context transformation state
	OLE: Smoother borders pÃ¥ info box
	KEVIN: Random Floaty spawning + drawing behind bubbles
	KEVIN: Arrow/vim -key scrolling

# SCRAP #
	Refactor Main into its own class for cleanliness - REASON: Too noisy and methods don't work well with eventlisteners
	Score system for visited nodes (Level and experience?) - REASON: Use colored nodes to visualize 'experience' and score
	Floaty speed proportional to size - REASON: Unimportant
	Floaties start spawning in field of view (and dissapears out of view) - REASON: Doesn't look as good as random floaties in a wide area
	Introduce a summary in the info box. Title - summary - longer text / details REASON Was proposed before content of factbox was html, coding no longer needed for this idea
