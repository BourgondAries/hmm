BUGS:
Zooming out doesn't transform the mouse coordinates correctly, you can't click on Bubbles

IDEAS:
Floaties start spawning in field of view (and dissapears out of view)
Education mode: Answer question to unlock new bubbles about more challenging things
Help menu button; describe keyboard shortcuts
Introduce a summary in the info box. Title - summary - longer text / details

	LONG(ER) TERM:
		Short cut to places around the canvas
		Mark nodes you've visited before
