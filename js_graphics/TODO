IDEA: Floaties start spawning in field of view

Center the old position after an onResize event
Zoom functionality (tricky?)
Sound toggle button (bgm og sfx) (ALL/BGM/SFX/NONE)
Picture/Sprite rendering inside the infoboxes
Clickable hyperlinks
Hyperlinks activating links to different bubbles
Music class for queing and loading after finishing
Add dev-key for showing various stats, most importantly current position
Use a single JS file for storing all bubbles and curves - this makes it easy for anyone to add something
