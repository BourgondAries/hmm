BUGS:


IDEAS:
Refactor Main into its own class for cleanliness
Floaties start spawning in field of view (and dissapears out of view)
Education mode: Answer question to unlock new bubbles about more challenging things
Help menu button; describe keyboard shortcuts
Introduce a summary in the info box. Title - summary - longer text / details
Persistence storage of visited nodes in cookie
Different coloration in the tree based on subject
'I master this' button in infobox to get score and color a node's text
Make the zoom zoom toward position of the mouse

	LONG(ER) TERM:
		Short cut to places around the canvas
		Mark nodes you've visited before
		Right-click add-node or 'Editor Mode', since editing Data.js is a pain in the ass. <- This could be in dev-mode?

TODO:
Semantic zoom
Latex rendering in infoboxes
Picture/Sprite rendering inside the infoboxes
Clickable hyperlinks in info box
Hyperlinks activating links to different bubbles
Music class for queing and loading after finishing
Scrolling in factBox
