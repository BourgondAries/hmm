IDEA: Floaties start spawning in field of view

Zoom functionality (tricky?)
Sound toggle button (bgm og sfx) (ALL/BGM/SFX/NONE)
Picture/Sprite rendering inside the infoboxes
Clickable hyperlinks
Hyperlinks activating links to different bubbles
Music class for queing and loading after finishing
Use a single JS file for storing all bubbles and curves - this makes it easy for anyone to add something

KEVIN: Add dev-key for showing various stats, most importantly current position
OLE: Bubble + Bubbles klasse
PARTIALLY DONE: OLE: Info box klasse

DONE: KEVIN: Use a gradient texture instead of the heavy fillrect
DONE: KEVIN: Center the old position after an onResize event
DONE: KEVIN: Different radii floaties
DONE: OLE/KEVIN: Curve class (the curves connecting bubbles)
DONE: KEVIN: Context class for managing global context transformation state
DONE: OLE: Smoother borders p√• info box
DONE: KEVIN: Random Floaty spawning + drawing behind bubbles
DONE: KEVIN: Arrow/vim -key scrolling
