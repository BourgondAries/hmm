BUGS:


IDEAS:
Create remote random music loader service
Refactor Main into its own class for cleanliness
Floaties start spawning in field of view (and dissapears out of view)
Education mode: Answer question to unlock new bubbles about more challenging things
Help menu button; describe keyboard shortcuts
Introduce a summary in the info box. Title - summary - longer text / details
Score system for visited nodes (Level and experience?)
Persistence storage of visited nodes in cookie
Different coloration in the tree based on subject

	LONG(ER) TERM:
		Short cut to places around the canvas
		Mark nodes you've visited before
		Right-click add-node or 'Editor Mode', since editing Data.js is a pain in the ass. <- This could be in dev-mode?

TODO:
Add 'm' key for quick mute
Add keys - and + for zooming
Latex rendering in infoboxes
Sound toggle button (bgm og sfx) (ALL/BGM/SFX/NONE)
Picture/Sprite rendering inside the infoboxes
Clickable hyperlinks in info box
Hyperlinks activating links to different bubbles
Music class for queing and loading after finishing
Make the zoom zoom toward position of the mouse
