Then we can write it $$\\sqrt{2}  = \\frac{a}{b}$$ where a, b are whole numbers, b not zero.\n<br><br>\nWe additionally assume that this a/b is simplified to lowest terms, since that can obviously be done with any fraction. Notice that in order for a/b to be in simplest terms, both of a and b cannot be even. One or both must be odd. Otherwise, we could simplify a/b further.\n<br><br>\nFrom the equality $$\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{a}{b}$$ it follows that $$2 = \\frac{a^2}{b^2}$$  or  $$a^2 = 2 \\cdot b^2$$.  So the square of a is an even number since it is two times something.\n\nFrom this we know that a itself is also an even number. Why? Because it can't be odd; if a itself was odd, then a Â· a would be odd too. Odd number times odd number is always odd.\n\nIf a itself is an even number, then a is 2 times some other whole number. In symbols, a = 2k where k is this other number. We don't need to know what k is; it won't matter. Soon comes the contradiction.\n\nIf we substitute a = 2k into the original equation $$2 = \\frac{a^2}{b^2}$$, this is what we get:\n\n$$2    =    (2k)^2/b^2$$\n$$2    =    4k^2/b^2$$\n$$2\\cdot b^2    =    4k^2$$\n$$b^2    =    2k^2$$\nThis means that $b^2$ is even, from which follows again that b itself is even.
