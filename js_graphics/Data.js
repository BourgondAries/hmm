Then we can write it $$\\sqrt{2}  = \\frac{a}{b}$$ where a, b are whole numbers, b not zero.\n<br><br>\nWe additionally assume that this a/b is simplified to lowest terms, since that can obviously be done with any fraction. Notice that in order for a/b to be in simplest terms, both of a and b cannot be even. One or both must be odd. Otherwise, we could simplify a/b further.\n<br><br>\nFrom the equality $$\\sqrt{2} = \\frac{a}{b}$$ it follows that $$2 = \\frac{a^2}{b^2}$$  or  $$a^2 = 2 \\cdot b^2$$.  So the square of a is an even number since it is two times something.\n\nFrom this we know that a itself is also an even number. Why? Because it can't be odd; if a itself was odd, then a Â· a would be odd too. Odd number times odd number is always odd.\n\nIf a itself is an even number, then a is 2 times some other whole number. In symbols, a = 2k where k is this other number. We don't need to know what k is; it won't matter. Soon comes the contradiction.\n\nIf we substitute a = 2k into the original equation $$2 = \\frac{a^2}{b^2}$$, this is what we get:\n\n$$2    =    (2k)^2/b^2$$\n$$2    =    4k^2/b^2$$\n$$2\\cdot b^2    =    4k^2$$\n$$b^2    =    2k^2$$\nThis means that b2 is even, from which follows again that b itself is even.

What if we have something like $$\\frac{5}{2}$$ Let's try: $$5 - 2 = 3$$ Now we have $$3$$ Next: $$3 -  2 = 1$$ If we subtract 2 once again, we get -1, an integer. So we can not divide the number. We are left at 1. This (1) is called the remainder. We can create a new type of number. We call this number a 'Rational Number'. It is called rational because it is defined by a ratio of two numbers.

        facts: "If you divide a number, you subtract the denominator from the numerator until the numerator is zero. Sometimes, the subtraction hops over the zero. In the expression 7 / 3, we first subtract via 7 - 3, which is 4. Then we subtract via 4 - 3, which is 1. Then we subtract via 1 - 3, which is -2. We have hopped over 0. If we want integer division, we use what we call a 'remainder'. We go back and look at the number that was before the jump over 0. This was 1. So we can now say: 7 / 3 is the same as 2, with remainder 1. Why is it 2? Because we could subtract 2 times.",
